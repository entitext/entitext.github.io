            <p>It is ReplAI's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
                Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
                Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect using Instagram platform which you provide us its permission.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, ReplAI collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
                of each visitor request. ReplAI's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ReplAI's visitors use its website. From time to time, ReplAI may release non-personally-identifying information
                in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>ReplAI also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. ReplAI only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                personally-identifying information as described below.</p>


            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to ReplAI's websites choose to interact with ReplAI in ways that require ReplAI to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ReplAI gathers depends on the nature of the
                interaction.
            </p>


            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
